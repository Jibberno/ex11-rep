    <h1 class="title">The Farmer And His Two Daughters</h1>
    <h2 class="fontname"></h2>
    <p class="fable">A MAN had two daughters, the one married to a gardener, and the
      other to a tile-maker. After a time he went to the daughter who
      had married the gardener, and inquired how she was and how all
      things went with her. She said, "All things are prospering with
      me, and I have only one wish, that there may be a heavy fall of
      rain, in order that the plants may be well watered." Not long
      after, he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker, and
      likewise inquired of her how she fared; she replied, "I want for
      nothing, and have only one wish, that the dry weather may
      continue, and the sun shine hot and bright, so that the bricks
      might be dried." He said to her, "If your sister wishes for rain,
      and you for dry weather, with which of the two am I to join my
      wishes?'</p>
